                          SINGLE ROW FUNCTION    MULTI ROW FUNCTION


1. SINGLE ROW FUNCTION :-
->SINGLE ROW FUNCTION ECECUTE ROW BY ROW.
->SRF WILL TAKE ONE INPUT AND PROCESS IT, EXECITES AND GENERATE THE OUTPUT.
->IF YOU PASS N... NO. OF INPUT THEN IT WILL GIVE  N.. NO OF OUTPUT.

2. MULTI ROW FUCTION :-
->MULTI ROW FUNCTION EXECUTES GROUP BY GORUP.
->IT TAKES ALL INPUT AT ONE SHORT AND THEN EXECUTES AND PROVIDES A SINGLE OUTPUT.
->IF PASS N.. NO. OF INPUT TO MRF IT RETURN ONLY ONE OUTPUT.

---> LIST OF MULTI ROW FUNCTION:-
1.MAX().
2.MIN().
3.SUM().
4.AVG().
5.COUNT().

EXAMPLE:
  -> MAX (SAL) = 5000
SALARY
1000
5000
3000
4000

NOT :- 
->MRF CAN ACCEPT ONLY ONE ARGUMENT COL_NAME OR AN EXPRESSION.
->ALONG WITH MRF WE ARE NOT SOPPOSE TO SUED ANY OTHER COL_NAME IN THE SELECT CLAUSE
->MRF IGNORE THE NULL.
->WE CANNOT USE A MRF IN WHERE CLAUSE.
->COUNT() IS THE ONLY MRF WHICH CAN ACCEPT '*' AS AN ARGUMENT.

ANSWER :-
01.
SQL>  SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(SAL)
  2   FROM EMP
  3   WHERE ENAME LIKE '%LL%';

  COUNT(*)   SUM(SAL)
---------- ----------
         2       2900

02.
SQL> SELECT COUNT(DEPTNO)
  2  FROM EMP;

COUNT(DEPTNO)
-------------
           14

03.
SQL> SELECT COUNT(*)
  2  FROM EMP
  3  WHERE ENAME LIKE '%Z%';

  COUNT(*)
----------
         0

04.
SQL> SELECT COUNT(*)
  2  FROM EMP
  3  WHERE ENAME LIKE '%S%S%';

  COUNT(*)
----------
         0

05.
SQL> SELECT MAX(SAL)
  2  FROM EMP
  3  WHERE JOB = 'ANALYST';

  MAX(SAL)
----------
      3000

06.
SQL> SELECT MIN(SAL)
  2  FROM EMP
  3  WHERE DEPTNO = 10 AND
  4  JOB IN ('MANAGER','CLERK');

  MIN(SAL)
----------
      1300

07.
SQL> SELECT AVG(SAL)
  2  FROM EMP
  3  WHERE JOB = 'CLERK';

  AVG(SAL)
----------
    1037.5

08.
SQL> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SAL)
  2  FROM EMP;

COUNT(DISTINCTSAL)
------------------
                12
